          <h1 class="display-3" id="who-we-are" style="font-family: stencil; margin-top: 1.5rem;">WHO WE ARE</h1>
          <hr>
          <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Our founder Paul, a qualified engineer and industrial designer, has used his skills to put customers needs at the heart of many well known organisations, including mobile phone networks; supermarkets; consumer electronics manufacturers and the NHS.</p>
          <p class="border-dark" style="background-color: #f1eee6; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px;">We believe that sustainable design can make the world a brighter and inclusive place, with better social, economic and environmental outcomes for all. And that innovation starts with the needs of those we serve and is the process of understanding how people, places, tools and services can be combined to create the best experience and outcomes for everyone involved.</p>
          <p>Since 2013 we've been building knowledge and connections in the energy industry, convinced we could create a fairer and greener solution for the places where we live, work and play. <br>The result is We Are Energy Co-operative.</p>

          <h1 class="display-3" id="inspiration" style="font-family: stencil; margin-top: 1.5rem;">INSPIRATION</h1>
          <hr>
          <h2>We start with people, not tools.</h2><br>
          <p>We Are Energy is building a member-owned movement that transforms how people power their lives through genuine energy democracy. At the heart of our mission stand the families, communities, and organisations whose lives we're changing - delivering immediate energy independence while creating genuine cooperative ownership of the systems that serve them.</p>
          <p>We recognise that many home and business owners would like to install solar panels or heat pumps and make use of the latest technologies like battery storage. But fewer than 4% of households have the funds to cover the prohibitive upfront costs of £8,000-£15,000 for these types of systems. Meanwhile, energy poverty affects millions of families who remain trapped in a system designed for corporate profit rather than community benefit. So, we've launched a new co-operative with no upfront cost to overcome this barrier.</p>

          <hr>
          <p id="vision" style="margin-top: 1rem;">We Are Energy Co-operative Limited is an organisation united by a vision:-<br>
            <h2>Beyond Clean Energy to Abundant Living.</h2><br>
                <p>We believe that when abundant, affordable energy meets community ownership, entirely new possibilities emerge. The buildings of 2035 won't just consume less energy-they'll become productive spaces where energy independence enables new forms of prosperity, where cooperative ownership creates regenerative community economics, where kitchen appliances might grow fresh food powered by member-owned renewable systems and where new possibilities can emerge.</p>

          <h1 class="display-3" style="margin-top: 2rem; font-family: stencil;">MISSION</h1>
          <hr>
          <p id="mission">Our mission is to build a co-operative that serves to ensure its people, partners and customers can share positive actions that help to protect our planet and deliver our vision.</p>
          <p id="mission">We Are Energy is developing the UK’s first member-owned next generation solar gigafactory, demonstrating that when communities control essential infrastructure, everyone prospers. Our strategic implementation plan shows how democratic ownership can scale from 501 founding members to 10+ million cooperative owners by 2050.</p>

          <p>We’ll do that initially by covering as many of the suitable roofs in the UK, so that their surfaces can generate electricity using solar photovoltaic panels. We will develop tools and services to help our members use the energy they need in the most caring, creative and collaborative ways - helping to reduce energy consumption and energy costs for all.</p>

          <h2>Our Revolutionary Solution: The Energy Efficiency Lease.</h2>
          <p>Our energy efficiency lease model removes every barrier to clean energy access while creating genuine cooperative ownership:<br>
          <b>Zero upfront costs</b> - We supply, install, and maintain everything.<br>
          <b>Immediate 50% discount</b> on all energy used versus Ofgem price cap throughout the lease term.<br>
          <b>Post-lease energy abundance</b> - Members pay only off-peak rates for imported energy while enjoying free use of all generated and stored power for life<br>
          <b>Cooperative dividends</b> - When we achieve sustainable EBIT-positive margins, members share in our success through annual dividends and our Energy Democracy Fund<br>
          <b>Lifetime member benefits</b> - Free battery replacements, system upgrades, and democratic participation in energy system decisions</p>

          <p><i style="background-color:#373837; color: #f1eee6;">To enable people at <b style="color:#c0d726;">no upfront cost*</b> to generate, store and efficiently use renewable energy wherever we can.</i></p>
          <p><b>*</b> No Upfront Cost means you <b>pay nothing</b> to install our superior solar generation and battery store system.</p>

          <p id="cooperative">We received our co-operative society regulated status from the UK's Financial Conduct Authority on the basis that we'll give an equal voice to all our members to help decide on our future.

Our membership is voluntary and open to all our stakeholders.</p>
          <p>We are a business driven by values (caring, creative and collaborative) not by the payment of capital. We can't wait and sit back any longer for others to make things better for our children or soothe our conscience on the sofa of ethical consumerism. This is the decade to be active and intentional in our choices, to make our world a better place with clarity of purpose and positive action.</p>

          <h2>The Cooperative Difference</h2>
          <p>Our cooperative structure ensures that all benefits flow directly to members rather than external shareholders, creating a regenerative economic model that grows stronger as it scales This isn't just about clean energy-it's about transforming how communities can own and control the essential infrastructure that powers their lives.</p>
          <p>Our plans are built to show how cooperative principles and patient capital, applied to energy systems, can eliminate fuel poverty while building the foundation for a future where abundant, democratic energy enables new forms of community prosperity and environmental regeneration.</p>

          <p>Together we are inspired to face the earth systems collapse and acknowledge the impact of our actions on the sustainability of our planet.</p>
